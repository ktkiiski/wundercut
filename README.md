# WunderCut

This is a solution to the ["Brilliant cut" Wundernut coding challenge](http://wunder.dog/brilliant-cut/) on fall 2017 by Wunder Dog.

To run this script, just check out this repository and run the Python script in the cloned directory:

    git clone https://github.com/ktkiiski/wundercut.git
    cd wundercut
    python wundercut.py

The script prints an ASCII table with the maximum profits from each gemstone type.
It also prints the total sum for all types.

The script works with both Python 2 and 3 versions.
